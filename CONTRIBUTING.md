# Contributing to OpenARaw

Thanks for your interest in OpenARaw. This is a small, single-maintainer
project that ships [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) Rust (and Python where
applicable) tooling for the open mass-spec stack.

Crates / packages in this repo: openaraw, openaraw-py.

## Contributing code (pull requests)

PRs are welcome for changes of any size, including large or breaking ones -
there's no requirement to open an issue first. That said, for larger changes
you may want to open an issue before writing code, especially if you're
unsure whether it fits the project's direction: a large PR that conflicts
with the roadmap can still be rejected even if the code itself is solid, and
an issue is a cheap way to check alignment before investing the time.

For any PR:

- Scope it to one logical change.
- Run `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  locally. CI will run them too.
- Run `cargo test --all` (and `pytest` if the change touches Python).
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `## [Unreleased]` with a
  short bullet describing the user-visible change.
- Prefer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- Code is ASCII only and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the crate
  explicitly opts in (`openaraw-py` allows `unsafe_code` because PyO3's
  generated bindings require it; `openaraw` itself does not).

## Vendor software and clean-room policy

If you are contributing to the Agilent MassHunter `.d` reader, please make
sure new format knowledge came from public datasets and your own analysis -
**do not** copy or paste vendor SDK headers, sources, decompiled code, or
proprietary specifications. See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) and
[CORPUS.md](CORPUS.md).

**Never use vendor software.** This is a clean-room project. Do not run,
depend on, or validate against Agilent's own tools, or anything that reads
`.d` data through Agilent's libraries - not in CI, not in tests, not in
local development. That means no MassHunter (Qualitative Analysis,
Quantitative Analysis, Acquisition, or any other MassHunter component), no
ChemStation, no OpenLab CDS, and no ProteoWizard `msconvert` (it links
Agilent's own MHDAC/MIDAC libraries to read `.d` data, so it counts as
vendor software here even though it's open source). Do not install them, do
not shell out to them, do not use their output as a reference "to check
your work against."

Correctness is argued only from open references: the `.xml`/`.xsd` schema
files Agilent ships alongside the data itself (reading those is not
reverse-engineering - it's just reading published, non-proprietary schema
files), the PSI-MS mzML schema, published open specifications, roundtrip
and self-consistency invariants, and independent open-source parsers used
purely as format checkers. Comparing, benchmarking, or tuning output
against vendor results is not allowed and would compromise the clean-room
status of the project. If you can only explain a field by having watched
what MassHunter shows for it, don't write that down - keep digging in the
bytes instead, or flag it as unresolved.

**Pull requests that were written or verified with the help of proprietary
vendor software will not be accepted**, regardless of code quality, since
accepting them would compromise the project's clean-room provenance. If
you've found a bug this way, or you'd simply rather not write the fix
yourself, please open an issue instead. Describe the symptom on the input
that triggers it - what's wrong, and on what file - without pasting vendor
tool output, vendor source, or values you learned by running vendor
software. We'll investigate and fix it from public references. Detailed
issue reports are genuinely useful and will be acted on.

`/workspaces/Projects/Data` (or wherever the corpus lives in your checkout)
holds real research data that can be expensive to redownload. Treat it as
read-only except for adding cache/derived files you clearly own.
